The Irish international heads to Glasgow after four years with Albion, following his move from Blackburn Rovers in 2016.
He moves to Parkhead with the aim of helping Celtic secure an unprecedented tenth successive league title.
Head coach Graham Potter said, “Shane is part of Albion history. He has been a big part of the club’s recent progress in winning promotion to the Premier League and in retaining our place in the top-flight.
“He is keen to play regularly and, with increased competition in the centre of defence, we cannot guarantee that. This move is a huge opportunity for Shane and on behalf of everyone at the club we wish him well for the season.
“From a personal point of view he has been an absolute pleasure to work with, and as a man and a character he is someone we all love.
“This has been a challenging year for him on and, more importantly, off the pitch, but I’m grateful for the opportunity I’ve had to work with Shane and develop the relationship I have with him.”",2020-09-02 10:01:46,,1018,96,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158683807653139&id=95602073138,,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,nan

💬 Head coach Potter said, “I have been looking forward to working with Ben for a long time. He was a player I was well aware of, even before I came to the club.
“He has gradually stepped up the EFL divisions, with Newport County, Peterborough United and Leeds United.
“He had a brilliant season helping Leeds to the title last season, and now he has the opportunity to show his qualities in the Premier League.
