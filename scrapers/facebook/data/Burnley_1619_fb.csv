The Clarets trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday, 29 April will now kick-off at 5.30pm and be shown live on BT Sport.
And Manchester United's visit to Turf Moor has been moved back a day to Sunday, 23 April, kick-off 2.15pm, for live screening on Sky Sports.
The fixture change against United is dependent, however, on the EFL Cup winners not reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup, which are scheduled for that weekend.
United are away to Chelsea in the quarter-finals.
