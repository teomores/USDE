“The club has come a long way and now they’re becoming an established Premier League club that are trying to operate in a sustainable fashion.

💬 “The facilities here are amazing and we’re very lucky to be here. It feels like we’re properly getting down to business.
“The tempo and intensity has gone up, and with it being our first year as full-time athletes last season, a lot of us found that tough because we weren’t used to training twice a week. Now we’ve managed to get used to that and we're into the swing of things.
“Last season we were unlucky with some of the results, especially at home, where we drew or got a 1-0 defeat. We know as a collective group that we can get more out of those games, and we definitely want to strive and finish higher up the table this season.
“Towards the end of the season we were a lot more positive and built up a lot more momentum, which we can hopefully take into this season.

10157388496768139,"🇩🇰 What a debut season Casper Ankergren had after joining in 2010 from Leeds United...
💬 “It was very different to what I was used to at Leeds. Under Dennis Wise, I wasn’t allowed to give the ball to the centre-backs. I remember doing push-ups in training just because I passed the ball to one of the centre-backs — everything was meant to go long.
“But I was always quite comfortable with the ball at my feet from my time in Denmark, so that didn’t bother me. We played some really good football [at Albion], maybe overplaying at times.
“We had GG [Gordon Greer], who was very good on the ball, Adam El-Abd improved incredibly and that was quite a surprise to me. We had players that wanted to receive the ball — Gary Dicker was one of the best players to come short with a man on his back.
“If you want to play the way we did, you need the players to show up, especially when the goalkeeper has it. Nobody was scared to receive the ball and that helped us achieve success.”",2019-06-26 12:00:01,,186,11,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157388496768139&id=95602073138,,186,3,0,0,0,0,nan
