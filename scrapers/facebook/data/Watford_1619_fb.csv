I used to do things like playing on the PlayStation quite a lot but it’s just not possible when you’ve got three kids running around different places. My kids are two, six and seven and my oldest daughter was only two when we moved down to Watford so this feels like home more than anywhere else to us as a family. They love their school and they have a lot of friends here, so we’re really settled. When I find time I do like watching other sports, especially boxing. I also watch snooker every now and then when it’s on. I recently bought a VR headset to try and the kids really like some of the games on there, so I do get to do a little bit of game-playing too!

10157774336426815,"“Every game is vitally important, but to put too much emphasis on any one game builds unnecessary pressure,” he said.
“My mantra, in terms of what I'm looking for, is to get as close to maximum as possible in every game. If we do that, there is a good chance of winning and that's what it's about. The most important thing, first and foremost, is to make sure we get the performance right. If we get that as close to perfect as possible, we've got a great chance of winning games. That's how it has to be.”

A performance to be proud of after the break. The Hornets really gave it a go after Gray pegged one back with 25 minutes to go, but in the end Lukaku and Smalling's first half goals were just enough to bring the 100 per cent record to an end.
Thanks for your excellent support this evening, Hornets fans 💛

A final scoreline which was harsh on the Hornets.
After Doucoure cancelled out Pedro's opener on the stroke of half-time, Pereyra handed Watford a 2-1 lead shortly after the break.
The Hornets were left to rue missed chances - two fantastic opportunities in particular for Richarlison - as Batshuayi pulled Chelsea level and then Azpilicueta headed the hosts in front with three minutes to go.
Deep into injury-time, Batshuayi added a fourth, but this was no walkover for the Blues, who ultimately inflicted a first away defeat of the season on Watford.
