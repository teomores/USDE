After 20 years of playing professional football, i‚Äôd like to thank every manager I‚Äôve had the pleasure of working with. To every player i‚Äôve played with, you‚Äôve been my second family! I‚Äôve had so many great memories that I‚Äôll never forget and i‚Äôve been so lucky to win trophies along the way.
Playing for my country has also been a huge privilege and source of pride for me. I‚Äôve always dreamed of walking off the pitch for the last time with my family and i‚Äôm thankful I‚Äôve had that moment with them.
