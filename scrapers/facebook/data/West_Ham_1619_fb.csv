""I think the players are after a more human touch in some ways. I think in years gone by, my era [as a player], you might have spoken to them every now and then, but you wouldn’t have had too much going on with them.
""I think now the players are looking for a lot more commitment from the manager to hear how things are going, what’s happening and, at the moment, we have very little news for the players which is disappointing because we can’t give them any updates to say when we’re going to start back to training at the moment.
