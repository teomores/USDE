Finn McEwan was the seven-year-old boy who was diagnosed with a rare bone marrow disease.
In a bid to find Finn a suitable donor the ‘Save Finn McEwan’ campaign was launched. Finn, a massive Evertonian, was invited into Finch Farm to meet the Everton players to help raise awareness of the campaign back in March 2015 (see video below).
After Finn’s regular clinic appointment at the Manchester Children’s Hospital this morning Finn and his family received the news they had been praying for. Professor Rob Wynn told Finn that as far as he was concerned his “leukemia is cured, and the other serious conditions following the transplant were resolved.”
We look forward to seeing Finn and his family back at Goodison Park soon - and for a long time to come. 🙌",2017-09-08 18:33:41,,1325,48,144,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154684890126277&id=56909226276,,1325,171,4,0,1,2,nan
